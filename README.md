# Diabetic-trends using EDA and Machine Learning
# Diabetes Prediction 

## Overview
This project involves predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical attributes using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features like glucose levels, BMI, and age, which are analyzed and processed to train predictive models. The primary goal is to develop accurate and interpretable models to assist in identifying potential diabetes cases.

## Why I Started
The project began as an exploration of machine learning techniques in healthcare. With diabetes being a prevalent condition, leveraging data to aid early prediction felt impactful. My goal was to understand the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation while improving my skills in handling real-world datasets.

## Goals
- Explore and visualize the dataset to understand underlying patterns.
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Optimize models to achieve high accuracy and F1 scores, ensuring balanced performance between precision and recall.

## Achievements
- Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis, including outlier detection and feature correlation.
- Built and evaluated KNN and SVM models with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Achieved significant insights into model performance, with SVM providing the best F1 score after optimization.

## Skills Learned
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding labels.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and optimizing KNN and SVM models for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilizing F1 score, confusion matrices, and classification reports to assess performance.

## Challenges
- **Imbalanced Data**: Ensured that both outcomes were given adequate attention during model training and evaluation.
- **Model Optimization**: Tuned hyperparameters for SVM and KNN using GridSearchCV to improve F1 scores.
- **Outlier Management**: Visualized and addressed outliers that impacted model accuracy.

## Journey
Starting with curiosity about applying machine learning to healthcare, this project provided a platform to combine theoretical knowledge with practical skills. I learned the importance of exploratory data analysis and the iterative nature of model improvement. From the initial data visualization to optimizing SVM parameters, this journey has been both challenging and rewarding.
